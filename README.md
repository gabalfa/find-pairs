## Task

The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.
​
#### Sample output is shown below.
```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
​
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
```

## Solution 
It is a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value, its time and space complexity was evaluated through the Big-O notation, in addition, it implements unit tests using Jest to validate the correctness of the code.


```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gabalfa/find-pairs.git
    cd find-pairs
    npm install
    npm run test
```

#### Overall Analysis:
- The space complexity of the code is O(n)
- The time complexity of the code is O(n)
